Here are some effective practices:\\n\\n## Filter, Group, or Aggregate Data\\nFor extensive datasets, consider filtering, grouping, or aggregating similar data points\u2014such as combining categories with minimal differences. This can reduce table length without losing essential insights.\\n\\nIn AuroraPrime Create, generating a TFL summary for a long table is easy; just click the **Go to Data Filter** button to set filter conditions and narrow down rows for content generation. \\n\\n![](images/image_20241030011072.png)\\n\\n## Split Tables by Category or Time Period\\nLengthy tables with multiple categories or time periods can be more readable when split into smaller, category-specific tables or time-segmented sections. For instance, adverse event tables might be divided by severity or causality, and efficacy tables could separate primary and secondary endpoints.\\n\\n## Summarize Key Data\\nFor excessively long tables, consider summarizing key findings in the main CSR body, with the full table included as an appendix. Highlighting the most relevant data directly within the report makes information more accessible, while detailed data remains available in the appendix.\\n\\nAuroraPrime Create enables quick, accurate summaries for lengthy tables.\\n\\n![](images/image_20241030011055.png)\\n\\n## Use Visual Summaries or Figures\\nVisual summaries, like graphs or plots, can make data easier to interpret. These are especially helpful for longitudinal data, subgroup analyses, or trends that might otherwise overwhelm readers in table form.\\n\\n## Provide Navigational Aids and Annotations\\nIn the CSR, include navigational aids such as hyperlinks in digital documents or clear notes for print versions. Annotations, like footnotes or brief summaries preceding long tables, help readers understand the context and significance of table contents without reading every detail.\\n\\n## Optimize Layout and Formatting\\nImproving layout\u2014reducing white space, adjusting font sizes, and narrowing margins\u2014can make tables more compact. Using alternating row colors or column shading can also enhance visual navigation in lengthy tables.\\n\\n## Use Appendices Strategically\\nPlacing very long tables in appendices often preserves the flow of the main CSR. A concise overview in the main text, with a reference to the appendix, lets readers access detailed data when needed.\\n\\nThese strategies ensure long tables in CSRs remain accessible, informative, and compliant with regulatory standards."},{"id":"/2024/10/25/ Style Matters Adhering to Style Guides in GenAI-Assisted Medical Writing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/25/ Style Matters Adhering to Style Guides in GenAI-Assisted Medical Writing","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-25 Style Matters Adhering to Style Guides in GenAI-Assisted Medical Writing.md","title":"Style Matters: Adhering to Style Guides in GenAI-Assisted Medical Writing","description":"In medical writing, especially for regulatory submissions, style is paramount for ensuring clarity, consistency, and professionalism.

However, the effectiveness of GenAI-generated content hinges significantly on the quality of the prompts used. \\n\\nWhen using AuroraPrime Create for clinical regulatory documents, the tool provides built-in GenAI prompts optimized for various scenarios. Additionally, it allows you to input specific prompts and examples to fine-tune outputs to meet your precise requirements. \\n\\n![](images/image_20241022121051.png)\\n\\nHere, we explore best practices for crafting prompts that yield precise, compliant, and high-quality regulatory documents. \\n\\n## Be specific and clear\\n\\nSpecificity is key when writing prompts. Vague requests can lead to ambiguous results. For instance, when generating a TFL summary, instead of asking for a \\"summary of the Disposition of Participants table,\\" specify key study information and highlight what you want to emphasize.\\n\\nA more effective prompt might be: \\n\\n\u201c*Generate a TFL summary interpreting the Disposition of Participants table. Highlight the number of participants screened, enrolled, completed the study, and reasons for discontinuation. Include a brief analysis of the retention rates and any notable trends observed in participant dropout.*\u201d \\n\\n## Provide examples\\n\\nWhenever possible, provide examples of writing to clarify expectations and set benchmarks for the GenAI. For a TFL summary, you might share: \\n\\n\\"*The proportions of subjects who discontinued study agent administration through Week 8 because of an AE are shown in Table [X]. A total of [NUMBER] ([PERCENTAGE]%) subjects in the [GROUP NAME] group and [NUMBER] ([PERCENTAGE]%) subjects receiving [Study Agent Name] discontinued study agent administration due to an AE. [System-Organ Class] was the system-organ class in which the highest proportion of subjects had AEs leading to discontinuation.*\\"\\n\\n## Utilize contextual information\\n\\nProviding context can significantly enhance the relevance of the output. Include details about the therapeutic area, study design, and any regulatory guidelines that must be followed. This is particularly important for documents like study protocols and CSRs that require adherence to specific regulatory frameworks. \\n\\nExample prompt: \\n\\n\u201c*Generate a TFL summary interpreting the Disposition of Participants table for a Phase II trial of Drug ABC in patients with moderate to severe asthma.* \u201d\\n\\n## Review and refine\\n\\nGenAI-generated content is not a final product. After generating the initial draft, thoroughly review it for accuracy, compliance, and clarity. Incorporate feedback to refine prompts for future use, improving the quality of subsequent outputs. \\n\\nExample refinement:\\n\\nIf the GenAI\u2019s initial draft lacked depth in the results section, adjust your prompt to emphasize data interpretation: \\n\\n\u201c*Revise the text to include a detailed analysis of efficacy outcomes and their clinical significance based on statistical results.*\u201d\\n\\n## Encourage iterations\\n\\nGenAI can be a powerful tool for iterative writing processes. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for multiple versions or alternative approaches. This can help uncover new insights or perspectives that may enhance your regulatory documents.\\n\\nAuroraPrime Create allows you to debug GenAI generation rules when configuring document templates. By generating content using uploaded examples and additional prompts, you can review debug history and select the most satisfactory rule. \\n\\n![](images/image_20241022131034.png)\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nGenAI-assisted medical writing holds great potential for increasing efficiency and consistency in regulatory documentation. By employing these best practices for crafting prompts, medical writers can maximize the effectiveness of GenAI tools, ensuring that CSRs, TFL summaries, and study protocols meet the high standards required for regulatory submissions. As we continue to integrate GenAI into our workflows, embracing these strategies will be essential in producing high-quality, compliant medical documents."},{"id":"/2024/10/16/ AlphaLife Sciences Highlights AI-Driven Innovations in Clinical Trials at 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/16/ AlphaLife Sciences Highlights AI-Driven Innovations in Clinical Trials at 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-16 AlphaLife Sciences Highlights AI-Driven Innovations in Clinical Trials at 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference.md","title":"Alphalife Sciences Highlights GenAI-Driven Automation in Clinical Trials at 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference","description":"At the 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference, Sharon Chen, CEO and founder of AlphaLife Sciences, delivered a compelling keynote on \u201cGenAI-Enabled eClinical Solutions.\u201d Held on October 12th, the event, themed \\"The Next Generation of Medicine,\\" brought together leaders from the pharmaceutical, biotech, and regulatory sectors.","date":"2024-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 16, 2024","tags":[{"label":"AuroraPrime","permalink":"/blog/tags/aurora-prime"},{"label":"Create","permalink":"/blog/tags/create"},{"label":"GenAI","permalink":"/blog/tags/gen-ai"}],"readingTime":1.085,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hunter Shen","title":"generative AI evangelist","imageURL":"https://video.myaurora.cn/adhoc/huntershen.jpeg","key":"Hunter"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"Hunter","tags":["AuroraPrime","Create","GenAI"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How to Craft Effective Prompts in GenAI-Assisted Medical Writing","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/22/ How to Craft Effective Prompts in AI-Assisted Medical Writing"},"nextItem":{"title":"7 Forms of Waste in Medical Writing and How to Eliminate Them","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/14/ 7 Forms of Waste in Medical Writing and How to Eliminate Them"}},"content":"![](images/image_20241017161042.png)\\n\\nAt the 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference, Sharon Chen, CEO and founder of AlphaLife Sciences, delivered a compelling keynote on \u201cGenAI-Enabled eClinical Solutions.\u201d Held on October 12th, the event, themed \\"The Next Generation of Medicine,\\" brought together leaders from the pharmaceutical, biotech, and regulatory sectors.\\n\\nOrganized by the [United States Chinese Pharmaceutical Association (SAPA-DC)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sapa-hq/), the conference showcased the Greater Washington DC/Baltimore area\'s prominent role as a biotech hub, home to over 300 life sciences companies.\\n\\nSharon Chen\u2019s keynote highlighted the transformative role of GenAI in drug development, particularly focusing on AlphaLife Sciences\u2019 flagship platform, **AuroraPrime**.

However, these opportunities come with significant challenges. \\n\\nOne of the challenges facing medical writers is AI hallucination. AI hallucination is a phenomenon where the model output is fabricated and not grounded by either the provided context or world knowledge. This can be particularly problematic in clinical documentation. Imagine an AI referencing studies, clinical trials, or research papers that don\'t exist. The consequences of such hallucinations can be grave, leading to misinformation and potentially harmful decisions in medical practice. \\n\\n## Why AI Hallucination Happens\\n\\n**Training Data Limitations**: AI models are trained on extensive datasets available up to a specific cut-off date. When the model encounters topics with limited or inconsistent training data, it may \\"hallucinate\\" by generating content that sounds plausible but is inaccurate.\\n\\n**Ambiguous or Insufficient Input**: Ambiguous or insufficient input undermines the AI\u2019s ability to accurately understand and respond, often degrading output quality and leading to hallucinated content. Ensuring clear, specific, and sufficient input can greatly improve the quality and reliability of AI-generated outputs. \\n\\n**Complexity of Medical Language**: Medical writing often involves highly technical language, complex relationships between terms, and specific regulatory standards, which increases the risk of hallucination if the AI doesn\'t fully understand these intricacies. Unlike generic knowledge, the knowledge required for creating clinical documents is exclusive to related organizations or even study-specific.\\n\\n**Model Configuration**: The default temperature of the Large Language Model (LLM) being used may dictate its creativity, which may not be configured by the end user. This can lead to more imaginative but less accurate outputs.\\n\\n![](images/image_20241012161091.png)\\n\\n## Address AI Hallucination in Medical Writing Using AuroraPrime Create\\n\\nSeamlessly integrated with Microsoft Word 365, AuroraPrime Create by AlphaLife Sciences is a Word add-in that harnesses generative AI to assist medical writers in creating clinical documentation. \\n### RAG-powered Knowledge Base\\n\\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a widely-used technique to enhance AI outputs by retrieving relevant documents and using them as additional context for generation. AuroraPrime Create enables you to easily build a corporate knowledge base that supports AI-driven content generation, seamlessly integrating it into your clinical documentation workflow. \\n\\nWhen generating an initial draft document from a template in AuroraPrime Create, you can upload related documents for content reuse and repurposing.

Image source:\xa0[Wei et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802))\\n\\n### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\\n\\nUsing a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach can effectively prevent AI hallucinations by incorporating human oversight at key decision-making stages, ensuring greater accuracy and reliability. AuroraPrime Create introduces human verification steps in certain specific processes and provides fast and efficient verification methods to compensate for the shortcomings of AI-generated outputs. \\n\\n### Contextual Prompt Tuning\\n\\nMainstream large language models possess an inherent capacity for self-awareness. AuroraPrime Create enhances this capability with built-in prompts specifically tuned to provide the appropriate context, further strengthening the model\'s self-knowledge. Users can also input additional prompts when generating AI-driven content, such as TFL summaries. This customization ensures that the AI model is aligned with the unique requirements and standards of the organization, further reducing the risk of hallucination. \\n\\n### Built-In Fact-Checking\\n\\nAlways verify AI-generated medical content against reliable data sources or knowledge bases, ensuring that referenced studies or clinical trials are real and accurately summarized.\\n\\nThe AuroraPrime Create add-in can automatically validate the accuracy and consistency of TFL summary objects against the TFL data, ensuring the summaries are coherent and aligned with their corresponding TFLs.\\n\\n## Wrapping Up\\n\\nAI hallucination poses a significant challenge in medical writing, but tools like AuroraPrime Create offer robust solutions to mitigate these risks. By leveraging RAG-powered knowledge bases, choosing the right LLM, and incorporating rigorous fact-checking, medical writers can ensure the accuracy and reliability of their clinical documentation. As the industry continues to evolve, staying informed and utilizing advanced tools will be key to maintaining high standards in medical writing."},{"id":"/2024/09/28/ How to Master the Art of Prompt Writing for AI Models in Medical Writing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/09/28/ How to Master the Art of Prompt Writing for AI Models in Medical Writing","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-28 How to Master the Art of Prompt Writing for AI Models in Medical Writing.md","title":"How to Master the Art of Prompt Writing for AI Models in Medical Writing","description":"A Fun Guide to Taming Your AI Assistant","date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 28, 2024","tags":[{"label":"GenAI","permalink":"/blog/tags/gen-ai"},{"label":"prompt","permalink":"/blog/tags/prompt"},{"label":"medical writing","permalink":"/blog/tags/medical-writing"}],"readingTime":1.705,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hunter Shen","title":"generative AI evangelist","imageURL":"https://video.myaurora.cn/adhoc/huntershen.jpeg","key":"Hunter"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"Hunter","tags":["GenAI","prompt","medical writing"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How to Combat AI Hallucination in Medical Writing","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/08/ How to Combat AI Hallucination in Medical Writing"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Latest News on GenAI in Clinical Trials","permalink":"/blog/2024/09/27/ The Latest News on GenAI in Clinical Trials"}},"content":"*A Fun Guide to Taming Your AI Assistant*\\n\\n![](images/image_20240924140935.png)\\n\\nCrafting effective prompts for medical writing AI models is the secret sauce to accurate and relevant outputs.

The platform integrates with widely used systems like Veeva Vault, allowing clinical trial teams to generate, review, and finalize reports faster, all while maintaining accuracy and compliance.\\n\\nThe core of AlphaLife\u2019s AI-driven medical writing tool revolves around its ability to summarize and populate essential documents. AI generates TFL (tables, figures, and listings) summaries, updates them as new data is received, and seamlessly integrates them into CSRs. This eliminates much of the manual effort traditionally associated with medical writing, allowing teams to focus on more strategic and high-level tasks.\\n\\n## **Challenges and Opportunities in China and Japan**\\nDuring the meeting, Sharon Chen also addressed the unique regulatory challenges in China and Japan, two markets where AlphaLife is working closely with GSK. In China, where regulatory requirements differ significantly from global standards, AlphaLife\u2019s AI tools help companies align global CSRs with local versions by facilitating side-by-side document comparisons. AI is also used to ensure that regulatory submissions meet China\u2019s stringent guidelines.\\n\\nIn Japan, medical writing teams face the added challenge of managing moving target documents, where global versions are constantly updated. AlphaLife\u2019s tools use medical coding and locked terminology to expedite the translation and submission process, preventing repeated proofreading and reducing time spent on document revisions. As the regulatory landscape in Japan is less strict regarding AI usage, companies there are more enthusiastic about adopting these AI-powered solutions, particularly in CSR writing and regulatory submissions.\\n\\n## **Digitizing the Protocol Design Process**\\nOne of the most exciting innovations highlighted during the meeting was AlphaLife\u2019s work in protocol design digitization. Protocol design is a critical phase in clinical trials, as it dictates the entire trial\u2019s methodology and data collection process. Sharon Chen explained that AlphaLife has built an end-to-end pipeline that automates the design and structuring of clinical trial protocols.\\n\\nThe process begins with AI reading and extracting data from public repositories like `ClinicalTrials.gov`, as well as from a company\u2019s internal documents. This information is then structured into a knowledge base that assists with content reuse for documents like CSRs and SAPs (Statistical Analysis Plans). Once a protocol is digitized, AlphaLife\u2019s platform can automatically generate EDC (Electronic Data Capture) forms and statistical plans, saving significant time during trial execution.\\n\\nIn addition to document generation, the platform integrates real-time data collection for improved patient monitoring and risk detection during trials. One of AlphaLife\u2019s oncology clients, for example, used the platform to detect potential risks earlier, allowing for quicker decision-making and improving patient safety.\\n\\n## **Scalability and Data Privacy**\\nScalability was another critical theme, with Sharon Chen emphasizing that AlphaLife\u2019s platform is highly modular and customizable. Clients can start with individual tools, such as the CSR writing module, and scale up as needed to include protocol design, real-time monitoring, and more.\\n\\nData privacy and regulatory compliance remain at the forefront of AlphaLife\u2019s strategy. The platform is built on Microsoft\u2019s Azure infrastructure, ensuring end-to-end encryption and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. In China, where data privacy is a major concern, AlphaLife has worked closely with local authorities to ensure that its AI tools comply with government regulations, particularly in B 2 B applications. \\n\\n## **The Future of AI in Clinical Trials**\\nLooking to the future, AlphaLife envisions AI playing an even larger role in predictive analytics and personalized medicine.
