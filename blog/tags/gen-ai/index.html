Following a structured style not only enhances the credibility of clinical documents but is also essential for regulatory approval.</p><p>While industry standards like the <em>AMA Manual of Style</em> provide a solid foundation, each company often has its own unique guidelines. For medical writers, aligning with both industry and corporate style guides is crucial for producing compliant and high-quality documentation.</p><p>Medical writers face several challenges when it comes to complying with writing style guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong>Navigating Extensive Rules</strong>: With hundreds of rules outlined in a typical style guide, complete compliance can be challenging.</li><li><strong>GenAI Integration</strong>: Generative AI (GenAI) may not always produce content that aligns with style guidelines, adding complexity to the process.</li><li><strong>Keeping Up with Changes</strong>: As style guides are regularly updated, medical writers face the added task of staying current.</li></ul><p>This is where AuroraPrime Create comes in. AuroraPrime Create streamlines this process through its <strong>AI Augmentation Strategy</strong> feature, where writers can configure and manage style guide rules directly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20241025151082-56dc22f58ce2fc54b840fdfe48286e89.png" width="1354" height="729" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>From language, tone, and grammar to citation formats, the system allows users to set custom prompts and rules for GenAI to follow. Once configured, AuroraPrime Create auto-generates narratives that adhere strictly to these style requirements. For large-scale document generation, writers can run this process server-side, leaving it to complete in the background and retrieving the finalized documents later under the Safety Narratives menu. The process remains active even if AuroraPrime is signed out or the browser is closed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20241025151053-a38a95cc282fb5c9e634d4608e28afe7.png" width="1354" height="729" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>By automating style compliance, AuroraPrime Create enables medical writers to produce regulatory-ready documentation with ease and precision.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/aurora-prime">AuroraPrime</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/create">Create</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/gen-ai">GenAI</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/style">Style</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/regulatory-submissions">Regulatory Submissions</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/consistency">Consistency</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ama-manual-of-style">AMA Manual of Style</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/generative-ai-gen-ai">Generative AI (GenAI)</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/aurora-prime-create">AuroraPrime Create</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/content-generation-rule-configuration">Content Generation Rule Configuration</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ai-augmentation-strategy">AI Augmentation Strategy</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="At the 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference, Sharon Chen, CEO and founder of AlphaLife Sciences, delivered a compelling keynote on “GenAI-Enabled eClinical Solutions.” Held on October 12th, the event, themed &quot;The Next Generation of Medicine,&quot; brought together leaders from the pharmaceutical, biotech, and regulatory sectors."><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/10/16/ AlphaLife Sciences Highlights AI-Driven Innovations in Clinical Trials at 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference">Alphalife Sciences Highlights GenAI-Driven Automation in Clinical Trials at 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 16, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://video.myaurora.cn/adhoc/huntershen.jpeg" alt="Hunter Shen" itemprop="image"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Hunter Shen</span></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">generative AI evangelist</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20241017161042-2791f6623c5901934bcb4262e3f83ff8.png" width="3388" height="1744" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At the 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference, Sharon Chen, CEO and founder of AlphaLife Sciences, delivered a compelling keynote on “GenAI-Enabled eClinical Solutions.” Held on October 12th, the event, themed &quot;The Next Generation of Medicine,&quot; brought together leaders from the pharmaceutical, biotech, and regulatory sectors.</p><p>Organized by the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sapa-hq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Chinese Pharmaceutical Association (SAPA-DC)</a>, the conference showcased the Greater Washington DC/Baltimore area&#x27;s prominent role as a biotech hub, home to over 300 life sciences companies.</p><p>Sharon Chen’s keynote highlighted the transformative role of GenAI in drug development, particularly focusing on AlphaLife Sciences’ flagship platform, <strong>AuroraPrime</strong>.

These non-value-adding activities create inefficiencies throughout processes, and applying lean principles to eliminate them is essential for optimizing productivity.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Image" src="/assets/images/image_20241015211095-0eeffa77ab1345b49fd01504b30a5b0f.png" width="1656" height="1202" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>These same lean principles are highly adaptable to medical writing, where inefficiencies can slow documentation workflows and compromise the quality of deliverables. By adopting a lean approach, medical writers can streamline document creation and improve overall quality, fostering faster and more effective communication within healthcare. Advanced tools like <em>AuroraPrime Create</em> from AlphaLife Sciences support these lean practices, enabling medical writers to enhance their workflow and reduce inefficiencies.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overproduction">Overproduction<a href="#overproduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overproduction" title="Direct link to Overproduction">​</a></h2><p>In manufacturing, overproduction occurs when more is produced than required or when production happens too early. This leads to excessive inventory and inefficiencies.</p><p>In medical writing, overproduction manifests as the generation of unnecessary or redundant content that adds little value to the reader. Over-documentation can clutter the workflow and overwhelm the audience.</p><p>Applying lean principles helps writers focus on creating only what is necessary, exactly when it’s needed. <em>AuroraPrime Create</em> promotes this with its <em>lean summary generation</em> feature, ensuring content is concise, relevant, and targeted to the audience’s needs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="waiting">Waiting<a href="#waiting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Waiting" title="Direct link to Waiting">​</a></h2><p>Waiting, another form of waste in manufacturing, occurs when processes are idle due to bottlenecks or downtime, delaying productivity.</p><p>In medical writing, this can take the form of delayed approvals, slow feedback cycles, or waiting for input from multiple stakeholders.

The meeting revealed AlphaLife’s comprehensive AI-driven solutions that are already transforming clinical trial processes, notably in medical writing and regulatory submissions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production"><strong>AI in Medical Writing: Accelerating Clinical Study Report (CSR) Production</strong><a href="#ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production" title="Direct link to ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production">​</a></h2><p>One of the standout themes from the discussion was how generative AI is reducing the time and effort required to produce CSRs. Sharon Chen highlighted that the cost of clinical trials is rising, while timelines are becoming less competitive. To address this, AlphaLife has been working on an AI platform designed to streamline processes across clinical trials, particularly in medical writing. </p><p>By leveraging large language models (LLMs), AlphaLife has developed a system capable of automating the first draft of CSRs with minimal user intervention. Sharon Chen cited Johnson &amp; Johnson as a key client that has already seen a 30% reduction in their CSR lifecycle thanks to this solution. The platform integrates with widely used systems like Veeva Vault, allowing clinical trial teams to generate, review, and finalize reports faster, all while maintaining accuracy and compliance.</p><p>The core of AlphaLife’s AI-driven medical writing tool revolves around its ability to summarize and populate essential documents. AI generates TFL (tables, figures, and listings) summaries, updates them as new data is received, and seamlessly integrates them into CSRs. This eliminates much of the manual effort traditionally associated with medical writing, allowing teams to focus on more strategic and high-level tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan"><strong>Challenges and Opportunities in China and Japan</strong><a href="#challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan" title="Direct link to challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan">​</a></h2><p>During the meeting, Sharon Chen also addressed the unique regulatory challenges in China and Japan, two markets where AlphaLife is working closely with GSK. In China, where regulatory requirements differ significantly from global standards, AlphaLife’s AI tools help companies align global CSRs with local versions by facilitating side-by-side document comparisons. AI is also used to ensure that regulatory submissions meet China’s stringent guidelines.</p><p>In Japan, medical writing teams face the added challenge of managing moving target documents, where global versions are constantly updated. AlphaLife’s tools use medical coding and locked terminology to expedite the translation and submission process, preventing repeated proofreading and reducing time spent on document revisions. As the regulatory landscape in Japan is less strict regarding AI usage, companies there are more enthusiastic about adopting these AI-powered solutions, particularly in CSR writing and regulatory submissions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="digitizing-the-protocol-design-process"><strong>Digitizing the Protocol Design Process</strong><a href="#digitizing-the-protocol-design-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to digitizing-the-protocol-design-process" title="Direct link to digitizing-the-protocol-design-process">​</a></h2><p>One of the most exciting innovations highlighted during the meeting was AlphaLife’s work in protocol design digitization. Protocol design is a critical phase in clinical trials, as it dictates the entire trial’s methodology and data collection process. Sharon Chen explained that AlphaLife has built an end-to-end pipeline that automates the design and structuring of clinical trial protocols.</p><p>The process begins with AI reading and extracting data from public repositories like <code>ClinicalTrials.gov</code>, as well as from a company’s internal documents. This information is then structured into a knowledge base that assists with content reuse for documents like CSRs and SAPs (Statistical Analysis Plans). Once a protocol is digitized, AlphaLife’s platform can automatically generate EDC (Electronic Data Capture) forms and statistical plans, saving significant time during trial execution.</p><p>In addition to document generation, the platform integrates real-time data collection for improved patient monitoring and risk detection during trials.
