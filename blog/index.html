Meeting with GSK</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20240925190937-4d00b59d88951b77cfe09833503ab19b.png" width="1024" height="581" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On August 21, 2024, Sharon Chen, CEO and co-founder of AlphaLife Sciences, and her executive team met with the global IT head of GSK to discuss the current and future applications of generative AI in clinical trials, with a specific focus on medical writing. The meeting revealed AlphaLife’s comprehensive AI-driven solutions that are already transforming clinical trial processes, notably in medical writing and regulatory submissions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production"><strong>AI in Medical Writing: Accelerating Clinical Study Report (CSR) Production</strong><a href="#ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production" title="Direct link to ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production">​</a></h2><p>One of the standout themes from the discussion was how generative AI is reducing the time and effort required to produce CSRs. Sharon Chen highlighted that the cost of clinical trials is rising, while timelines are becoming less competitive. To address this, AlphaLife has been working on an AI platform designed to streamline processes across clinical trials, particularly in medical writing. </p><p>By leveraging large language models (LLMs), AlphaLife has developed a system capable of automating the first draft of CSRs with minimal user intervention. Sharon Chen cited Johnson &amp; Johnson as a key client that has already seen a 30% reduction in their CSR lifecycle thanks to this solution. The platform integrates with widely used systems like Veeva Vault, allowing clinical trial teams to generate, review, and finalize reports faster, all while maintaining accuracy and compliance.</p><p>The core of AlphaLife’s AI-driven medical writing tool revolves around its ability to summarize and populate essential documents. AI generates TFL (tables, figures, and listings) summaries, updates them as new data is received, and seamlessly integrates them into CSRs. This eliminates much of the manual effort traditionally associated with medical writing, allowing teams to focus on more strategic and high-level tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan"><strong>Challenges and Opportunities in China and Japan</strong><a href="#challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan" title="Direct link to challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan">​</a></h2><p>During the meeting, Sharon Chen also addressed the unique regulatory challenges in China and Japan, two markets where AlphaLife is working closely with GSK. In China, where regulatory requirements differ significantly from global standards, AlphaLife’s AI tools help companies align global CSRs with local versions by facilitating side-by-side document comparisons. AI is also used to ensure that regulatory submissions meet China’s stringent guidelines.</p><p>In Japan, medical writing teams face the added challenge of managing moving target documents, where global versions are constantly updated. AlphaLife’s tools use medical coding and locked terminology to expedite the translation and submission process, preventing repeated proofreading and reducing time spent on document revisions. As the regulatory landscape in Japan is less strict regarding AI usage, companies there are more enthusiastic about adopting these AI-powered solutions, particularly in CSR writing and regulatory submissions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="digitizing-the-protocol-design-process"><strong>Digitizing the Protocol Design Process</strong><a href="#digitizing-the-protocol-design-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to digitizing-the-protocol-design-process" title="Direct link to digitizing-the-protocol-design-process">​</a></h2><p>One of the most exciting innovations highlighted during the meeting was AlphaLife’s work in protocol design digitization. Protocol design is a critical phase in clinical trials, as it dictates the entire trial’s methodology and data collection process. Sharon Chen explained that AlphaLife has built an end-to-end pipeline that automates the design and structuring of clinical trial protocols.</p><p>The process begins with AI reading and extracting data from public repositories like <code>ClinicalTrials.gov</code>, as well as from a company’s internal documents. This information is then structured into a knowledge base that assists with content reuse for documents like CSRs and SAPs (Statistical Analysis Plans). Once a protocol is digitized, AlphaLife’s platform can automatically generate EDC (Electronic Data Capture) forms and statistical plans, saving significant time during trial execution.</p><p>In addition to document generation, the platform integrates real-time data collection for improved patient monitoring and risk detection during trials. One of AlphaLife’s oncology clients, for example, used the platform to detect potential risks earlier, allowing for quicker decision-making and improving patient safety.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scalability-and-data-privacy"><strong>Scalability and Data Privacy</strong><a href="#scalability-and-data-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to scalability-and-data-privacy" title="Direct link to scalability-and-data-privacy">​</a></h2><p>Scalability was another critical theme, with Sharon Chen emphasizing that AlphaLife’s platform is highly modular and customizable. Clients can start with individual tools, such as the CSR writing module, and scale up as needed to include protocol design, real-time monitoring, and more.</p><p>Data privacy and regulatory compliance remain at the forefront of AlphaLife’s strategy. The platform is built on Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure, ensuring end-to-end encryption and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. In China, where data privacy is a major concern, AlphaLife has worked closely with local authorities to ensure that its AI tools comply with government regulations, particularly in B 2 B applications. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-future-of-ai-in-clinical-trials"><strong>The Future of AI in Clinical Trials</strong><a href="#the-future-of-ai-in-clinical-trials" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-future-of-ai-in-clinical-trials" title="Direct link to the-future-of-ai-in-clinical-trials">​</a></h2><p>Looking to the future, AlphaLife envisions AI playing an even larger role in predictive analytics and personalized medicine. By analyzing historical and real-time data, AI can help predict trial outcomes and identify potential risks early, which would allow for more proactive decision-making. In the realm of personalized medicine, AI could match patients with the most appropriate trials based on their genetic profiles or medical histories, thereby improving trial outcomes and patient care.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to conclusion" title="Direct link to conclusion">​</a></h2><p>AlphaLife Sciences is poised to revolutionize the clinical trial and medical writing industry through its innovative use of generative AI. By reducing the time and effort required to produce essential documents like CSRs, and by digitizing the protocol design process, AlphaLife’s platform is setting new standards for efficiency, accuracy, and compliance. As AI technology evolves, AlphaLife is committed to staying at the forefront, continuously improving its platform to meet the needs of the pharmaceutical industry.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/aurora-prime">AuroraPrime</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/create">Create</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/gen-ai">GenAI</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="A Fun Guide to Taming Your AI Assistant"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/09/25/ How to Master the Art of Prompt Writing for AI Models in Medical Writing">How to Master the Art of Prompt Writing for AI Models in Medical Writing</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-25T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 25, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://video.myaurora.cn/adhoc/huntershen.jpeg" alt="Hunter Shen" itemprop="image"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Hunter Shen</span></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">generative AI evangelist</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>A Fun Guide to Taming Your AI Assistant</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20240924140935-0239c0b0e07198e5e9ea729364e444e9.png" width="1024" height="581" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Crafting effective prompts for medical writing AI models is the secret sauce to accurate and relevant outputs.

In a speech filled with vision and technical insight, Chen outlined how her company is revolutionizing clinical trials through AI-powered solutions that promise to drastically reduce costs, enhance accuracy, and speed up the delivery of life-saving medicines. </p><p>Chen’s message resonated deeply with an audience of pharma industry leaders and tech innovators who share a common challenge: the ever-rising costs and complexities of clinical trials. “Clinical trials are becoming more expensive and time-consuming, and the urgency to bring treatments to patients faster has never been greater,” Chen said. Her solution? Generative AI—an emerging technology that is already proving its transformative potential across various industries.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transforming-clinical-trials-with-ai">Transforming Clinical Trials with AI<a href="#transforming-clinical-trials-with-ai" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transforming Clinical Trials with AI" title="Direct link to Transforming Clinical Trials with AI">​</a></h3><p>AlphaLife Sciences, headquartered in Singapore, is a four-year-old startup making waves globally for its innovative approach to clinical trial management. The company collaborates with leading pharmaceutical and CRO (Contract Research Organization) companies to bring generative AI solutions into clinical trial workflows. With prestigious partnerships including Google for Startups, Microsoft for Startups, Nvidia&#x27;s Inception Program, and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s JLab, AlphaLife is rapidly gaining traction as a leader in clinical trial innovation.</p><p>Chen explained that her company’s flagship platform, <strong>AuroraPrime</strong>, leverages generative AI to address some of the most critical pain points in clinical trials—specifically, medical writing and documentation. The platform is designed to automate the creation of complex reports like Clinical Study Reports (CSRs), cutting down the time and labor traditionally required for this critical task.</p><p>“In the medical writing process, teams face the challenge of consolidating information from various sources—internal data, public information, and external collaborations,” Chen remarked. “This is a time-consuming process prone to human error, but it’s one that can be dramatically improved with AI.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-era-of-efficiency-and-accuracy">A New Era of Efficiency and Accuracy<a href="#a-new-era-of-efficiency-and-accuracy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A New Era of Efficiency and Accuracy" title="Direct link to A New Era of Efficiency and Accuracy">​</a></h3><p>During her keynote, Chen highlighted three pivotal areas where generative AI can drive change: first draft automation, efficient template configuration, and full lifecycle integration of documents. According to her, these innovations will not only accelerate the creation of clinical trial documents but also ensure higher quality and consistency.</p><p>“Everyone knows the power of tools like ChatGPT for generating content quickly,” Chen noted. “But in regulated scientific fields like clinical trials, quality is paramount. The content must be consistent, precise, and accurate—AI cannot afford to make mistakes here.”</p><p>AlphaLife&#x27;s solution? A rigorous AI framework that teaches models how to produce scientifically accurate, regulation-compliant content for medical writers. The AI is trained to summarize complex protocols, analyze statistical data, and generate TFL summaries with a level of consistency that is critical in clinical trials. Importantly, medical writers remain at the heart of the process, using AI as a tool to assist but not replace their expertise.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="seamless-integration-for-medical-writers">Seamless Integration for Medical Writers<a href="#seamless-integration-for-medical-writers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Integration for Medical Writers" title="Direct link to Seamless Integration for Medical Writers">​</a></h3><p>A standout feature of the AuroraPrime platform is its seamless integration with the tools medical writers already use, such as Microsoft Word. “We wanted to make sure the transition to AI-powered solutions would be as smooth as possible for medical writers,” Chen said. “Our platform integrates directly into their existing workflow, which means they can continue working in the environments they are most comfortable with.”</p><p>Chen further explained how the platform makes it easy for medical writers to configure templates without needing to write any code. Once a template is set up, it can be reused across multiple documents, further streamlining the process and reducing manual effort. The platform even enables content reuse across different studies, saving significant time in the creation of new reports.</p><p>“We’ve designed AuroraPrime to handle the full lifecycle of clinical trial documents,” Chen explained. “From protocol creation to final submissions, AI is driving efficiencies at every step, reducing errors and accelerating the process.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="eliminating-hallucinations-the-ai-challenge">Eliminating Hallucinations: The AI Challenge<a href="#eliminating-hallucinations-the-ai-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Eliminating Hallucinations: The AI Challenge" title="Direct link to Eliminating Hallucinations: The AI Challenge">​</a></h3><p>A major concern within the AI community is the issue of “hallucination,” where AI models generate false or misleading content. Chen acknowledged this challenge, especially in the highly regulated pharmaceutical space. “Hallucination is a real issue when using general-purpose models,” she said. “But our solution is built differently. By training the AI with golden datasets, generated from historical clinical trial documents, we’ve minimized this risk.”</p><p>Chen’s team has developed an advanced quality control mechanism, ensuring that the AI’s outputs meet the strict scientific and regulatory standards required in clinical trial documentation. The framework allows medical writers to fine-tune AI outputs, providing prompts and examples that guide the model in real time. This flexibility ensures that every document produced meets the highest standards of accuracy and consistency.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ais-role-in-the-future-of-pharma">AI’s Role in the Future of Pharma<a href="#ais-role-in-the-future-of-pharma" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AI’s Role in the Future of Pharma" title="Direct link to AI’s Role in the Future of Pharma">​</a></h3><p>In her closing remarks, Chen was optimistic about the future of AI in healthcare. “AI is not just about cutting costs and saving time—although those are clear benefits,” she said. “It’s about improving the quality and reliability of the documents that are so critical in clinical trials. It’s about helping medical writers do their jobs better, and ultimately, it’s about bringing life-saving treatments to patients faster.”</p><p>Chen&#x27;s keynote made it clear that AlphaLife Sciences is at the forefront of a critical transformation in the pharmaceutical industry. With generative AI, the tedious and error-prone process of clinical trial documentation is becoming faster, more efficient, and more reliable. As AlphaLife continues to innovate and push the boundaries of what AI can do, the future of clinical trials looks increasingly bright.</p><p>As the keynote wrapped up, attendees were invited to visit AlphaLife’s booth for a hands-on demonstration of the AuroraPrime platform. There was palpable excitement in the room, as industry professionals and innovators alike could see the potential of AI-driven solutions to address one of the most pressing challenges in modern drug development.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/aurora-prime">AuroraPrime</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/create">Create</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/gen-ai">GenAI</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sharon-chen">Sharon Chen</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/d-pharm">DPharm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="In the labyrinthine world of medical writing, where precision meets professionalism, and jargon dances with journal articles, there&#x27;s a new superstar in town—AuroraPrime Create by AlphaLife Sciences.
