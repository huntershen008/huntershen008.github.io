However, the effectiveness of AI-generated content hinges significantly on the quality of the prompts used. </p><p>When using AuroraPrime Create for clinical regulatory documents, the tool provides built-in AI prompts optimized for various scenarios. Additionally, it allows you to input specific prompts and examples to fine-tune outputs to meet your precise requirements. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20241022121051-721da2795161daf81a759c95c0397520.png" width="676" height="485" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Here, we explore best practices for crafting prompts that yield precise, compliant, and high-quality regulatory documents. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-specific-and-clear">Be specific and clear<a href="#be-specific-and-clear" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Be specific and clear" title="Direct link to Be specific and clear">â</a></h2><p>Specificity is key when writing prompts. Vague requests can lead to ambiguous results. For instance, when generating a TFL summary, instead of asking for a &quot;summary of the Disposition of Participants table,&quot; specify key study information and highlight what you want to emphasize.</p><p>A more effective prompt might be: </p><p>â<em>Generate a TFL summary interpreting the Disposition of Participants table. Highlight the number of participants screened, enrolled, completed the study, and reasons for discontinuation. Include a brief analysis of the retention rates and any notable trends observed in participant dropout.</em>â </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="provide-examples">Provide examples<a href="#provide-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Provide examples" title="Direct link to Provide examples">â</a></h2><p>Whenever possible, provide examples of writing to clarify expectations and set benchmarks for the AI. For a TFL summary, you might share: </p><p>&quot;<em>The proportions of subjects who discontinued study agent administration through Week 8 because of an AE are shown in Table <!-- -->[X]<!-- -->. A total of <!-- -->[NUMBER]<!-- --> (<!-- -->[PERCENTAGE]<!-- -->%) subjects in the <!-- -->[GROUP NAME]<!-- --> group and <!-- -->[NUMBER]<!-- --> (<!-- -->[PERCENTAGE]<!-- -->%) subjects receiving <!-- -->[Study Agent Name]<!-- --> discontinued study agent administration due to an AE. <!-- -->[System-Organ Class]<!-- --> was the system-organ class in which the highest proportion of subjects had AEs leading to discontinuation.</em>&quot;</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="utilize-contextual-information">Utilize contextual information<a href="#utilize-contextual-information" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Utilize contextual information" title="Direct link to Utilize contextual information">â</a></h2><p>Providing context can significantly enhance the relevance of the output. Include details about the therapeutic area, study design, and any regulatory guidelines that must be followed. This is particularly important for documents like study protocols and CSRs that require adherence to specific regulatory frameworks. </p><p>Example prompt: </p><p>â<em>Generate a TFL summary interpreting the Disposition of Participants table for a Phase II trial of Drug ABC in patients with moderate to severe asthma.</em> â</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="review-and-refine">Review and refine<a href="#review-and-refine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Review and refine" title="Direct link to Review and refine">â</a></h2><p>AI-generated content is not a final product. After generating the initial draft, thoroughly review it for accuracy, compliance, and clarity. Incorporate feedback to refine prompts for future use, improving the quality of subsequent outputs. </p><p>Example refinement:</p><p>If the AIâs initial draft lacked depth in the results section, adjust your prompt to emphasize data interpretation: </p><p>â<em>Revise the text to include a detailed analysis of efficacy outcomes and their clinical significance based on statistical results.</em>â</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="encourage-iterations">Encourage iterations<a href="#encourage-iterations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Encourage iterations" title="Direct link to Encourage iterations">â</a></h2><p>AI can be a powerful tool for iterative writing processes. Donât hesitate to ask for multiple versions or alternative approaches. This can help uncover new insights or perspectives that may enhance your regulatory documents.</p><p>AuroraPrime Create allows you to debug AI generation rules when configuring document templates. By generating content using uploaded examples and additional prompts, you can review debug history and select the most satisfactory rule. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20241022131034-1686052aeb742be31453751ba6cf22c0.png" width="1886" height="1394" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts<a href="#final-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final thoughts" title="Direct link to Final thoughts">â</a></h2><p>AI-assisted medical writing holds great potential for increasing efficiency and consistency in regulatory documentation. By employing these best practices for crafting prompts, medical writers can maximize the effectiveness of AI tools, ensuring that CSRs, TFL summaries, and study protocols meet the high standards required for regulatory submissions. As we continue to integrate AI into our workflows, embracing these strategies will be essential in producing high-quality, compliant medical documents.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ai-tools">AI tools</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/medical-writing">Medical writing</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/regulatory-documents">Regulatory documents</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/prompts">Prompts</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/clinical-study-reports-cs-rs">Clinical Study Reports (CSRs)</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/tables-figures-and-listings-tfl">Tables, Figures, and Listings (TFL)</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/specificity">Specificity</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/contextual-information">Contextual information</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="At the 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference, Sharon Chen, CEO and founder of AlphaLife Sciences, delivered a compelling keynote on âGenAI-Enabled eClinical Solutions.â Held on October 12th, the event, themed &quot;The Next Generation of Medicine,&quot; brought together leaders from the pharmaceutical, biotech, and regulatory sectors."><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/10/16/ AlphaLife Sciences Highlights AI-Driven Innovations in Clinical Trials at 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference">Alphalife Sciences Highlights GenAI-Driven Automation in Clinical Trials at 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 16, 2024</time> Â· <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://video.myaurora.cn/adhoc/huntershen.jpeg" alt="Hunter Shen" itemprop="image"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Hunter Shen</span></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">generative AI evangelist</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20241017161042-2791f6623c5901934bcb4262e3f83ff8.png" width="3388" height="1744" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At the 2024 SAPA-DC Annual Conference, Sharon Chen, CEO and founder of AlphaLife Sciences, delivered a compelling keynote on âGenAI-Enabled eClinical Solutions.â Held on October 12th, the event, themed &quot;The Next Generation of Medicine,&quot; brought together leaders from the pharmaceutical, biotech, and regulatory sectors.</p><p>Organized by the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sapa-hq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Chinese Pharmaceutical Association (SAPA-DC)</a>, the conference showcased the Greater Washington DC/Baltimore area&#x27;s prominent role as a biotech hub, home to over 300 life sciences companies.</p><p>Sharon Chenâs keynote highlighted the transformative role of GenAI in drug development, particularly focusing on AlphaLife Sciencesâ flagship platform, <strong>AuroraPrime</strong>.

However, these opportunities come with significant challenges. </p><p>One of the challenges facing medical writers is AI hallucination. AI hallucination is a phenomenon where the model output is fabricated and not grounded by either the provided context or world knowledge. This can be particularly problematic in clinical documentation. Imagine an AI referencing studies, clinical trials, or research papers that don&#x27;t exist. The consequences of such hallucinations can be grave, leading to misinformation and potentially harmful decisions in medical practice. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-ai-hallucination-happens">Why AI Hallucination Happens<a href="#why-ai-hallucination-happens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why AI Hallucination Happens" title="Direct link to Why AI Hallucination Happens">â</a></h2><p><strong>Training Data Limitations</strong>: AI models are trained on extensive datasets available up to a specific cut-off date. When the model encounters topics with limited or inconsistent training data, it may &quot;hallucinate&quot; by generating content that sounds plausible but is inaccurate.</p><p><strong>Ambiguous or Insufficient Input</strong>: Ambiguous or insufficient input undermines the AIâs ability to accurately understand and respond, often degrading output quality and leading to hallucinated content. Ensuring clear, specific, and sufficient input can greatly improve the quality and reliability of AI-generated outputs. </p><p><strong>Complexity of Medical Language</strong>: Medical writing often involves highly technical language, complex relationships between terms, and specific regulatory standards, which increases the risk of hallucination if the AI doesn&#x27;t fully understand these intricacies. Unlike generic knowledge, the knowledge required for creating clinical documents is exclusive to related organizations or even study-specific.</p><p><strong>Model Configuration</strong>: The default temperature of the Large Language Model (LLM) being used may dictate its creativity, which may not be configured by the end user. This can lead to more imaginative but less accurate outputs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image_20241012161091-9f110993492d491724fea597b660b35c.png" width="1900" height="602" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="address-ai-hallucination-in-medical-writing-using-auroraprime-create">Address AI Hallucination in Medical Writing Using AuroraPrime Create<a href="#address-ai-hallucination-in-medical-writing-using-auroraprime-create" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Address AI Hallucination in Medical Writing Using AuroraPrime Create" title="Direct link to Address AI Hallucination in Medical Writing Using AuroraPrime Create">â</a></h2><p>Seamlessly integrated with Microsoft Word 365, AuroraPrime Create by AlphaLife Sciences is a Word add-in that harnesses generative AI to assist medical writers in creating clinical documentation. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rag-powered-knowledge-base">RAG-powered Knowledge Base<a href="#rag-powered-knowledge-base" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to RAG-powered Knowledge Base" title="Direct link to RAG-powered Knowledge Base">â</a></h3><p>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a widely-used technique to enhance AI outputs by retrieving relevant documents and using them as additional context for generation.

The meeting revealed AlphaLifeâs comprehensive AI-driven solutions that are already transforming clinical trial processes, notably in medical writing and regulatory submissions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production"><strong>AI in Medical Writing: Accelerating Clinical Study Report (CSR) Production</strong><a href="#ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production" title="Direct link to ai-in-medical-writing-accelerating-clinical-study-report-csr-production">â</a></h2><p>One of the standout themes from the discussion was how generative AI is reducing the time and effort required to produce CSRs. Sharon Chen highlighted that the cost of clinical trials is rising, while timelines are becoming less competitive. To address this, AlphaLife has been working on an AI platform designed to streamline processes across clinical trials, particularly in medical writing. </p><p>By leveraging large language models (LLMs), AlphaLife has developed a system capable of automating the first draft of CSRs with minimal user intervention. Sharon Chen cited Johnson &amp; Johnson as a key client that has already seen a 30% reduction in their CSR lifecycle thanks to this solution. The platform integrates with widely used systems like Veeva Vault, allowing clinical trial teams to generate, review, and finalize reports faster, all while maintaining accuracy and compliance.</p><p>The core of AlphaLifeâs AI-driven medical writing tool revolves around its ability to summarize and populate essential documents. AI generates TFL (tables, figures, and listings) summaries, updates them as new data is received, and seamlessly integrates them into CSRs. This eliminates much of the manual effort traditionally associated with medical writing, allowing teams to focus on more strategic and high-level tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan"><strong>Challenges and Opportunities in China and Japan</strong><a href="#challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan" title="Direct link to challenges-and-opportunities-in-china-and-japan">â</a></h2><p>During the meeting, Sharon Chen also addressed the unique regulatory challenges in China and Japan, two markets where AlphaLife is working closely with GSK. In China, where regulatory requirements differ significantly from global standards, AlphaLifeâs AI tools help companies align global CSRs with local versions by facilitating side-by-side document comparisons. AI is also used to ensure that regulatory submissions meet Chinaâs stringent guidelines.</p><p>In Japan, medical writing teams face the added challenge of managing moving target documents, where global versions are constantly updated. AlphaLifeâs tools use medical coding and locked terminology to expedite the translation and submission process, preventing repeated proofreading and reducing time spent on document revisions. As the regulatory landscape in Japan is less strict regarding AI usage, companies there are more enthusiastic about adopting these AI-powered solutions, particularly in CSR writing and regulatory submissions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="digitizing-the-protocol-design-process"><strong>Digitizing the Protocol Design Process</strong><a href="#digitizing-the-protocol-design-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to digitizing-the-protocol-design-process" title="Direct link to digitizing-the-protocol-design-process">â</a></h2><p>One of the most exciting innovations highlighted during the meeting was AlphaLifeâs work in protocol design digitization. Protocol design is a critical phase in clinical trials, as it dictates the entire trialâs methodology and data collection process. Sharon Chen explained that AlphaLife has built an end-to-end pipeline that automates the design and structuring of clinical trial protocols.</p><p>The process begins with AI reading and extracting data from public repositories like <code>ClinicalTrials.gov</code>, as well as from a companyâs internal documents. This information is then structured into a knowledge base that assists with content reuse for documents like CSRs and SAPs (Statistical Analysis Plans). Once a protocol is digitized, AlphaLifeâs platform can automatically generate EDC (Electronic Data Capture) forms and statistical plans, saving significant time during trial execution.</p><p>In addition to document generation, the platform integrates real-time data collection for improved patient monitoring and risk detection during trials. One of AlphaLifeâs oncology clients, for example, used the platform to detect potential risks earlier, allowing for quicker decision-making and improving patient safety.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scalability-and-data-privacy"><strong>Scalability and Data Privacy</strong><a href="#scalability-and-data-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to scalability-and-data-privacy" title="Direct link to scalability-and-data-privacy">â</a></h2><p>Scalability was another critical theme, with Sharon Chen emphasizing that AlphaLifeâs platform is highly modular and customizable. Clients can start with individual tools, such as the CSR writing module, and scale up as needed to include protocol design, real-time monitoring, and more.</p><p>Data privacy and regulatory compliance remain at the forefront of AlphaLifeâs strategy. The platform is built on Microsoftâs Azure infrastructure, ensuring end-to-end encryption and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. In China, where data privacy is a major concern, AlphaLife has worked closely with local authorities to ensure that its AI tools comply with government regulations, particularly in B 2 B applications. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-future-of-ai-in-clinical-trials"><strong>The Future of AI in Clinical Trials</strong><a href="#the-future-of-ai-in-clinical-trials" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-future-of-ai-in-clinical-trials" title="Direct link to the-future-of-ai-in-clinical-trials">â</a></h2><p>Looking to the future, AlphaLife envisions AI playing an even larger role in predictive analytics and personalized medicine.

The platform is designed to automate the creation of complex reports like Clinical Study Reports (CSRs), cutting down the time and labor traditionally required for this critical task.</p><p>âIn the medical writing process, teams face the challenge of consolidating information from various sourcesâinternal data, public information, and external collaborations,â Chen remarked. âThis is a time-consuming process prone to human error, but itâs one that can be dramatically improved with AI.â</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-era-of-efficiency-and-accuracy">A New Era of Efficiency and Accuracy<a href="#a-new-era-of-efficiency-and-accuracy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A New Era of Efficiency and Accuracy" title="Direct link to A New Era of Efficiency and Accuracy">â</a></h3><p>During her keynote, Chen highlighted three pivotal areas where generative AI can drive change: first draft automation, efficient template configuration, and full lifecycle integration of documents. According to her, these innovations will not only accelerate the creation of clinical trial documents but also ensure higher quality and consistency.</p><p>âEveryone knows the power of tools like ChatGPT for generating content quickly,â Chen noted. âBut in regulated scientific fields like clinical trials, quality is paramount. The content must be consistent, precise, and accurateâAI cannot afford to make mistakes here.â</p><p>AlphaLife&#x27;s solution? A rigorous AI framework that teaches models how to produce scientifically accurate, regulation-compliant content for medical writers. The AI is trained to summarize complex protocols, analyze statistical data, and generate TFL summaries with a level of consistency that is critical in clinical trials. Importantly, medical writers remain at the heart of the process, using AI as a tool to assist but not replace their expertise.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="seamless-integration-for-medical-writers">Seamless Integration for Medical Writers<a href="#seamless-integration-for-medical-writers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Integration for Medical Writers" title="Direct link to Seamless Integration for Medical Writers">â</a></h3><p>A standout feature of the AuroraPrime platform is its seamless integration with the tools medical writers already use, such as Microsoft Word. âWe wanted to make sure the transition to AI-powered solutions would be as smooth as possible for medical writers,â Chen said. âOur platform integrates directly into their existing workflow, which means they can continue working in the environments they are most comfortable with.â</p><p>Chen further explained how the platform makes it easy for medical writers to configure templates without needing to write any code. Once a template is set up, it can be reused across multiple documents, further streamlining the process and reducing manual effort. The platform even enables content reuse across different studies, saving significant time in the creation of new reports.</p><p>âWeâve designed AuroraPrime to handle the full lifecycle of clinical trial documents,â Chen explained. âFrom protocol creation to final submissions, AI is driving efficiencies at every step, reducing errors and accelerating the process.â</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="eliminating-hallucinations-the-ai-challenge">Eliminating Hallucinations: The AI Challenge<a href="#eliminating-hallucinations-the-ai-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Eliminating Hallucinations: The AI Challenge" title="Direct link to Eliminating Hallucinations: The AI Challenge">â</a></h3><p>A major concern within the AI community is the issue of âhallucination,â where AI models generate false or misleading content. Chen acknowledged this challenge, especially in the highly regulated pharmaceutical space. âHallucination is a real issue when using general-purpose models,â she said. âBut our solution is built differently. By training the AI with golden datasets, generated from historical clinical trial documents, weâve minimized this risk.â</p><p>Chenâs team has developed an advanced quality control mechanism, ensuring that the AIâs outputs meet the strict scientific and regulatory standards required in clinical trial documentation. The framework allows medical writers to fine-tune AI outputs, providing prompts and examples that guide the model in real time. This flexibility ensures that every document produced meets the highest standards of accuracy and consistency.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ais-role-in-the-future-of-pharma">AIâs Role in the Future of Pharma<a href="#ais-role-in-the-future-of-pharma" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AIâs Role in the Future of Pharma" title="Direct link to AIâs Role in the Future of Pharma">â</a></h3><p>In her closing remarks, Chen was optimistic about the future of AI in healthcare. âAI is not just about cutting costs and saving timeâalthough those are clear benefits,â she said. âItâs about improving the quality and reliability of the documents that are so critical in clinical trials. Itâs about helping medical writers do their jobs better, and ultimately, itâs about bringing life-saving treatments to patients faster.â</p><p>Chen&#x27;s keynote made it clear that AlphaLife Sciences is at the forefront of a critical transformation in the pharmaceutical industry. With generative AI, the tedious and error-prone process of clinical trial documentation is becoming faster, more efficient, and more reliable. As AlphaLife continues to innovate and push the boundaries of what AI can do, the future of clinical trials looks increasingly bright.</p><p>As the keynote wrapped up, attendees were invited to visit AlphaLifeâs booth for a hands-on demonstration of the AuroraPrime platform. There was palpable excitement in the room, as industry professionals and innovators alike could see the potential of AI-driven solutions to address one of the most pressing challenges in modern drug development.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/aurora-prime">AuroraPrime</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/create">Create</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/gen-ai">GenAI</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sharon-chen">Sharon Chen</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/d-pharm">DPharm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="In the labyrinthine world of medical writing, where precision meets professionalism, and jargon dances with journal articles, there&#x27;s a new superstar in townâAuroraPrime Create by AlphaLife Sciences.
